From July 3 to July 14, 2023, [the School of Journalism and Communication](http://jcr.ruc.edu.cn/English/index.htm) (in conjunction with [the Research Center of Journalism and Social Development](http://xwjd.ruc.edu.cn/en/index.htm)) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at Renmin University. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, guest speeches, group seminars (flipped classrooms), participant-led research projects, and so on. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia and industry. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, computer vision, data visualization, machine learning, and research ethics. There will be ample opportunities for participants to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released as open source.

Participation is restricted to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 25 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the offline entire two-week program in Beijing. This event is free of charge. The participants are expected to cover their own travel and accommodation expenses during this event.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2023/beijing/apply) are due 11:59 pm on May 1, 2023 (Beijing time).

For any questions, please contact us at sicss_beijing@163.com.
