Therefore instead of writing tutorials which are long, fancy and full with nice codes, we are going to suggest three introductory guides and two abstract case studies, and provide guidance every week till SICSS via zoom and Slack. The tasks cover data collection, cleaning and reporting. We are leaving the analysis to SICSS weeks."
    - name: "**Dinner Talks**<br/> While working Pre-SICSS tasks, informal small group dinner talks will be organized to share our experiences, discuss on project ideas, talk about SICSS materials, and chat on participant's questions."

We collected data from publicly available and globally known newspapers with a focus on 1-year period by using web scraping techniques. We made word clouds and sentiment analysis among descriptive statistics as preliminary findings. Then, we applied STM and derived some words to apply dictionary analysis. We applied a difference-in-differences (DID) model to the panel data we got. *[by Cansu Başak, Efe Başlar, F.

In this project, We have used [the COVID-19 Twitter Database: Turkey Sample](https://zenodo.org/record/3908982#.XvWlVZMzZpI) which is the first study to analyse the change in Turkish Twitter-sphere during the pandemic. Around 4.5 million Turkish tweets collected before and after the official announcement of the first coronavirus case in Turkey, 11 March 2020.  We will [identify bot users and news agencies](https://github.com/betulozturan/Bots-during-Covid-19) in the dataset and classify users as real person, bot, and news agency.  With the quantitative text analysis techniques, We [describe public opinion change](https://github.com/burakozturan/tria-covid19). We will investigate how bots behave during pandemic as well as the real users’ and bot users’ interaction through social network analysis.

The study shows that, although Australian state officials did not name the actor behind the attacks, China emerged as the main culprit, at least in the eyes of the Twitter users. The main conclusion is that the public attribution of cyber attacks is possible even in the absence of hard evidence. *[by Ozan Ahmet Cetin](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/istanbul/people)*"
