Our goal for the Summer Institute is to contrast the post-COVID influx of GetCalFresh (food stamp) applications with earlier applications. In what ways are new applicants and their circumstances distinctive from those in the past? What new challenges may today’s applicants be facing that ought to be receiving greater attention from policymakers or the media? Specifically, we would like to 1) identify these compositional changes and surface new challenges individuals may be facing, 2) highlight these through interactive visualizations and other content for a major revision to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) stories microsite, and 3) explore research collaborations academic participants may want to pursue with us.

Our project focuses on understanding the impact of school closure policies on the ability of teachers to get crucial materials to their students. We want to map trends in our daily aggregate state-level project posting data against the beginning of state school closure policies, and against state-level COVID-19 case numbers. We'd love to analyze what happened in each state when DonorsChoose implemented initiatives to allow teachers to ship materials to a location other than their school. We're hoping to get a broad understanding of which states' teachers were hit hardest by the pandemic on their ability to get materials through us, and which states' teachers are benefitting the most from our distance learning initiatives.

Our project seeks to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on young people’s health and wellbeing. COVID-19 has disrupted nearly every aspect of our lives, and that’s profoundly true for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) too. There’s a lot we still don’t know, but we do know that challenges already facing AYAs in the U.S. are likely to get worse. For example: dramatic increases in social isolation and associated mental health problems in what was already the loneliest generation ever; unprecedented disruption of higher education and its value proposition, likely exacerbating financial and educational disparities; widening access barriers to maternal/child health for low income young women; increased wellbeing and safety risk for LGBTQ+ youth who may be sheltering in place in unsupportive/unsafe homes; consequences of the explosion of teen vaping, to name a few. For our project, we’d love to tap into this group’s creativity and data science toolkit to explore new ways to use high quality, publicly available datasets (e.g., teen stress and mental health surveys, federal student loan data, sexual and gender minority health data) to generate new insights into drivers of AYA vulnerability and resilience during COVID, to identify needs and digital intervention targets, and/or to create novel digital measures of impact and change over time."

      bio: "The Natural Language Processing (NLP@UCSF) team is part of an ongoing initiative to develop a UCSF-based community of practice focused on natural language processing (NLP) and its applications to health disparities, clinical & biomedical research and healthcare. Our mission is to connect practitioners, enable collaborations, learning, and knowledge sharing, and to provide a support network for diverse teams. To facilitate multidisciplinary research aimed at reducing health disparities in COVID-19, promoting inclusion in COVID-19 discourse, and informing public health policy, NLP@UCSF is partnering with the Panacea Lab at Georgia State University (GSU) and BAY-SICSS to analyze the Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset. This data consists of over 361 million COVID-19 related tweets collected from January 27th to today. The COVID-19 Twitter chatter data captures all languages, but the higher prevalence languages are: English, Spanish, and French. Potential projects include: 1) identifying misinformation spread (retweets are available for this); 2) characterizing social discourse of policies, such as shelter-in-place, use of masks, among others, and 3) COVID-19 health disparities (e.g. disproportionate impact on African American, LatinX, and Asian communities, essential workers, prison populations, and people experiencing homelessness), and 4) potential human rights issues with contact tracing, law enforcement, public health, and privacy.  This data include daily tallies of the most common COVID19 bigrams and trigrams. For example, a potential project could aim to analyze this data over time to examine discourse on public health interventions  (i.e. social distancing and masks) using NLP techniques (e.g. LDA topic modeling, Word2Vec) over time. We encourage and are open to all approaches (e.g. machine learning and statistics) and to project ideas."

      bio: "Opening the Data of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic is a project of the UCSF Archives and Special Collections to prepare digitized archival materials on HIV/AIDS as textual data for use in computational research in the health sciences and humanities. UCSF Archives' mission is to identify, collect, organize, interpret, and maintain rare and unique material to support research and teaching of the health sciences and medical humanities and to preserve institutional memory. The No More Silence project aims to facilitate new research and discovery that bridges gaps between patient care, the lived-experiences of people with AIDS, and the historical and cultural components of the epidemic by allowing for analysis of large sets of textual data from this historical moment using one dataset. What can we discover when we are able to ask questions of a large corpus of records at once, tracing things such as the adoption of diverse terminology around gender across time and institutions, and the sentiments around different treatments and therapies as they entered the arena of possibility for the first time? This dataset allows researchers to begin asking such questions across multiple archival collections at different institutions and using hundreds of thousands of pages of documents. This project is open to collaborations with other teams. The UCSF@NLP team has collaborated with the No More Silence Initiative to examine discourse in the AIDS epidemic. Potential projects could focus on comparative research on discourse on the COVID-19 pandemic and AIDS epidemic."
