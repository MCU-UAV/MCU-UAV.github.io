  bio: "I am currently completing my master’s degree in statistics at Haifa University. I have vast experience as a teaching assistant for a dozen courses in the university’s statistics department. These have varied from courses in probability and statistical theory to machine learning, statistical modeling and programming in Python and R. I also have experience helping social scientists to conceptualize, collect and analyze the data they need for their research."

  - name: Noga Aviad
  bio: "I completed B.Sc. studies at BIU in computer science and neuroscience. I then worked for several years as a software developer in the high-tech industry, and returned to academia due to my curiosity about consciousness broadly and mindfulness in particular. My M.A. thesis used machine learning to analyze EEG data of meditators. Currently, I am extending this line of research in my Ph.D., using Complex Dynamical Systems approach to study mindfulness mechanisms."
