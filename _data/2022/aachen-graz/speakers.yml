  bio: "Alina Arseniev-Koehler is a computational and cultural sociologist with substantive interests in language, health, and social categories. Alina strives to clarify core concepts and debates about cultural meaning in sociology, such as how humans process meanings in their cultural environment and how widely-shared meanings are encoded in language. Alina's empirical work focuses on cases where meaning is linked to stigma and inequality, such as the moralization of body weight and disease."
