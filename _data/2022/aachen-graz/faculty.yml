  bio: "I am a PostDoc at David Garcia's Computational Social Science lab at the Graz University of Technology and the Complexity Science Hub Vienna. Drawing from my experience in nonlinear dynamical systems, my current research activity centres around emergent phenomena in complex social systems. I employ methods from machine learning, data science, sociophysics to understand a diverse range of topics, from emotion dynamics to the spread of diseases and misinformation in the field of Computational Social Science.<br /><a href=\"https://janalasser.at/\">https://janalasser.at</a>"

  bio: "I am a computational social scientist working at RWTH Aachen University. After receiving a doctoral degree from HSE University in Moscow, I founded and led a computational social science research group there. We were using big data and machine learning to better understand human behavior and complex social phenomena. Our main focus was on inequality in education and the psychological well-being of students.<br /><a href=\"https://ismirnov.eu\">https://ismirnov.eu</a>"

  bio: "David holds computer science degrees from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (Spain) and ETH Zurich (Switzerland). David did a PhD and Postdoc at ETH Zurich, working at the chair of systems design. His research focuses on computational social science, designing models and analysing human behaviour through digital traces. His main work revolves around the topics of emotions, polarization, inequality, and privacy, combining statistical analyses of large datasets of online interaction with computational models. His thesis “Modeling collective emotions in online communities” provides an example of how agent-based modeling can be used to construct an integrated approach to collective emotional phenomena in cyberspace. His postdoctoral research on opinion polarization and online privacy has been funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the ETH Risk Centre. <a href=\"https://dgarcia.eu/\">https://dgarcia.eu/</a>"

  bio: "I am a PhD candidate at the Medical University of Vienna, Graz University of Technology and Complexity Science Hub. I am part of the Computational Social Science Lab Austria, led by David Garcia, where we study human behavior through digital traces. Previously, I have studied mathematics at the University of Bologna. I am mainly interested in approaching linguistic theories through data science and in the use of the insights gained in such process for the creation of novel NLP methods. In my PhD I study the linguistic idea of colexification from a computational point of view."

  bio: "Max Pellert has a background in Cognitive Science and Economics (University of Vienna, Austria and University of Ljubljana, Slovenia). He was a doctoral researcher affiliated to Complexity Science Hub Vienna and Medical University of Vienna in the WWTF research group 'Emotional Well-Being in the Digital Society' lead by David Garcia (University of Konstanz). He works now as Assistant Researcher at Sony CSL Rome. His research focuses on analyzing the digital traces of individual and collective emotional behavior and affective expression on social media. He is broadly interested in the social sciences and uses traditional and novel computational methods to study emotion dynamics, belief updating, collective emotions and other interesting phenomena."
