# Overview 

1. What is R? 
2. Why use R? 
3. Getting started in R: 
    a. Data Management 
    b. Version Control 
4. A Sample Analysis 

# What is R? 

- Statistical analysis software
- computer language (base = S)
- based on social justice 
    - created by Maori scholars to democratice the reserach enterprise 

![Ross Ihaka & Robert Gentleman](~/Dropbox/SiCSS_Hunter/R_founders.png)    

# Why use R? 

Pros:

  - R can do it all 
    
    - mapping, most quant analysis, text analysis, network analysis, etc.
  
  - Facilitates reproducibility 
  
  - Same for all operating systems
  
  - Cool graphics capabilities 
  
  - Not just analysis 
  
      - Ex. does this look like a normal powerpoint?)

# Why use R? 

Pros:

  - Global support 
  
    - R Bloggers
        
    - Quick R
        
    - Stack Overflow
        
  - Lots of online textbooks 
  
    - TidyText 
        
    - R for Data Science

  - Used in most social science fields (collaboration+)
  
  - FREE!!!
  
# Why use R? 
                
Cons:

  - Takes ~6 months to get working knowledge  
  
  - You're learning a new language!!
  
  - Not a huge part of SW training (Yet!)
          
# Getting started with R 

R Demo

Rstudio Demo 

# Getting started with R: Data Management 

1. Create a directory

Method A: point and click in Rstudio 

Method B: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
dir.create("data")
dir.create("data_output")
dir.create("fig_output")
```

# Getting started with R: Data Management 

1. Create a directory

2. Organize your directory 

![Source: Data Carpentry](~/Dropbox/SiCSS_Hunter/directory_flow.png)    

# Getting started with R: Data Management 

1. Create a directory 

2. Organize your directory 

3. Gather and clean your data 
    - clean data programatically as often as possible
    - always keep raw data original (i.e analysis with copy)
    
# Getting started with R: Data Management 

1. Create a directory 

2. Organize your directory 

3. Gather and clean your data 

4. Install packages for your analysis 
    
# Getting started with R: Data Management     

4. Install packages for your analysis 

Method A: the packages tab in Rstudio 

Method B: code!

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
#the second line actually loads the package for use 
```

# Getting started with R: Version Control

As you analyze data, you need a way to keep track of what you've done

  - Ex. "final.doc", "final_v1.doc", "final.todays.date.doc", 

Git = version control software

Github = publicly share your repositories with others (collaboration!)

# Getting started with R: Version Control

1. Install Git on your computer 

Mac: Use the Terminal application 

```{r eval=FALSE}
#macs come with git pre-installed
#open terminal and type
which git
git --version
#we need to install homebrew to install git
ruby -e 
"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com
/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
#above three lines should be 1 line on your computer
brew install git
#now what version?
which git
git --version
```

# Getting started with R: Version Control

1. Install Git on your computer 

Mac: Use the Terminal application (continued) 

```{r eval=FALSE}
#configure git 
git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
git config --global user.email 'your@email.com'
#remember your password 
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

# Getting started with R: Version Control

1. Install Git on your computer 

  - MAC: 
  
    https://github.com/jennybc/stat540_2014/blob/master/seminars/seminar92_git.md

  - PC:
  
    http://git-scm.com/download/win
  
    - More PC Help:

# Getting started with R: Version Control

2. Git commands 

  - Commit = save what you've done to your repository 
  
  - Push = send the updates to Git 
  
  - Pull = update to most recent version of repository  (if collaborating)
  
  - Branch = make a copy of an exisitng repository 
  
      - Rstudio can't do this directly:
          - create your branch in GitHub and pull the changes to repository OR
          - create them in shell
          
            ```{r eval=FALSE}
             git checkout -b new-branch
            ```
  - Merge = combine your modifications back into main respository

# Getting started with R: Version Control

3. Work with Git in your code 

Rstudio and Git: 

https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077?version=1.1.442&mode=desktop)

# Getting started with R: Version Control

3. Work with Git in your code OR 

Do it on GitHub!

# A Sample Analysis 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Let's run through a sampele analysis of a built in R dataset
data("mtcars")
#Find out more about the dataset
?mtcars
#dataset structure
str(mtcars)
#first 5 observations
head(mtcars)
```

# A Sample Analysis Continued

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#last 5 observations
tail(mtcars)
# Number of rows (observations)
nrow(mtcars)
# Number of columns (variables)
ncol(mtcars)
#variable names 
names(mtcars)
#descriptive stats for each variable 
summary(mtcars)
```

# A Sample Analysis 

Using the Quick R website (https://www.statmethods.net/) complete the following: 

1. Calculate the mode for all variables 
2. Examine correlations between all variables (bonus if you do it with a graph)
3. Run a linear regression with mpg as the dependent variable and 3 independent          variables 
4. Recreate this next graph 

# A Sample Analysis: Recreate this graph  

```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  ylab("Miles per Gallon") +
  xlab("No. of Horsepower") +
  ggtitle("Impact of Number of Horsepower on MPG")
```
