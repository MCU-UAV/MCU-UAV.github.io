  bio: "Brian C. Keegan is a computational social scientist whose research is at the intersection of human-computer interaction, network science and data science. His research explores the structure and dynamics of large-scale online communication and collaboration using socio-technical system log data. Brian is developing new methods, theories and tools to help people make better sense of bursts of information and design better responses to them. Before joining CU-Boulder as an Assistant Professor, Keegan was a research associate at the Harvard Business School’s HBX online learning platform and a postdoctoral researcher in computational social science at Northeastern University. He received his PhD in media, technology and society from Northwestern University’s School of Communication. He also earned SB degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Science, Technology and Society from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."

  bio: "Allison Morgan is pursuing her Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Colorado, Boulder. She is interested in using data mining, machine learning, and social network analysis to develop and test hypotheses about the origins and effects of gender imbalance within academia. She attended last year's SICSS and is excited to build a computational social science community at CU Boulder via this satellite. She was recently awarded the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship. Prior to graduate school, Allison worked as a data scientist for two years at a small tech start-up in Portland, OR. She earned her B.A. in physics from Reed College."
