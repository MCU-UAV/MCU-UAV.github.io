  bio: "Roberto Cerina is a third-year DPhil candidate in Sociology at Nuffield College, University of Oxford, with an interest in Election Forecasting, Bayesian Statistics and non-representative surveys. His recent work has focused on making inference on electoral preferences from revealed behaviour on social-media; in particular, together with Professor Raymond Duch, he has forecasted the 2018 mid-term elections in Texas using likes from pages of public candidates on Facebook, leveraging the latest technology in prediction and post-stratification, and achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art surveys, at a fraction of the cost (see here from more: http://raymondduch.com/forecasts/). Currently he is working on forecasting the 2019 Indian Lok Sabha Elections using a convenience sample and Mechanical Turks. He is also working on finalising a Machine Learning pipeline to produce fully automated Opinion Polling from Twitter."
